# ictal-SPECT-ASL


The code for 2 ictal SPECT pipelines IISASL and ISASL is provided. The goal is to identify ictal hyperperfusion by statistically comparing the scan-to-scan differences to healthy controls. In this case, those of ASL and SPECT images. The normalized scan-to-scan ASL differences can be found here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/KZ29r4vtdjgiYUk


Ictal-interictal SPECT-ASL reguires both ictal and interictal SPECT image and a 3D structural MRI image as input.

Ictal SPECT-ASL requires only the ictal SPECT images and 3D structural MRI image as input.
