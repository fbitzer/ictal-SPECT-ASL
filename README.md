# ictal-SPECT-ASL


The code for 2 ictal SPECT pipelines IISASL and ISASL is provided. The goal is to identify ictal hyperperfusion by statistically comparing the scan-to-scan differences to healthy controls. In this case, those of ASL and SPECT images. The normalized scan-to-scan ASL differences can be found here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/KZ29r4vtdjgiYUk


Ictal-interictal SPECT-ASL reguires both ictal and interictal SPECT image and a 3D structural MRI image as input.

Ictal SPECT-ASL requires only the ictal SPECT images and 3D structural MRI image as input.

To date, the code is uploaded for demonstratory purposes and will be developed further so be easily usable in future releases.
